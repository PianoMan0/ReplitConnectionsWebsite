description: Reconnecting a fallen community.

I am [@MilesWK](https://github.com/MilesWK), a Replit enthusiast and the creator of ReplitConnections. This platform is a community-driven project to reconnect users of Replit after the removal of its community features.

This website serves as a repository for active users, projects, and resources related to Replit. I found it important to create a centralized space for Replit enthusiasts to collaborate and share ideas. 

If you find any errors or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.
